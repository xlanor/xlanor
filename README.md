Devops engineer, with a background in fullstack development.

I am fluent in `go`, `python`, `node`, and have varying levels of experience in `java` and `c++`.

Currently, I am most active in the **golang** community, where I actively seek out projects where I can contribute with my skillset.

In addition, my free time is also mostly spent mentoring my friends in the basics of web development.

I work at a startup company, [AcePointer](https://acepointer.sg), where I encounter challenging problems and get to work with modern technologies such as Kubernetes

Previously, I maintained several following OSS projects.


- [Hera](https://github.com/xlanor/SIM-UoW-Timetable-bot), a scraper used by over 300 students at its peak to manage timetables instead of using SIMConnect's slow and non-responsive website.
- [Minvera](https://github.com/xlanor/Minvera), a reddit bot to bypass premium news articles.
- [Janus](https://github.com/xlanor/Janus), a telegram butler bot that would handle message movements between related telegram groups.
